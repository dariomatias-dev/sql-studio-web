# Security Policy

## Scope

This repository is a static marketing site (SSG, no user accounts, no
backend, no database). Forms (`/contact`, `/download`) submit directly to
EmailJS from the browser; there's no server of our own handling that data.
There is no login and no stored user data. Realistic concerns here are
things like: a dependency with a known vulnerability, a Content Security
Policy bypass, a cross-site scripting vector, or a build/CI supply-chain
issue — not account takeover or a data breach, since neither accounts nor
stored user data exist.

## Supported versions

There's a single deployed version: whatever is on the `main` branch and
live in production. There's no version matrix or LTS branch to track.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please don't open a public issue for a security report. Instead:

1. Prefer GitHub's private vulnerability reporting: **Security** tab →
   **Report a vulnerability**. If that option isn't visible on this
   repository, it hasn't been enabled yet. Use the email fallback below.
2. Fallback: email
   [matiasdario75@gmail.com](mailto:matiasdario75@gmail.com) with
   "SECURITY" in the subject line.

Include, as far as you can:

- What the vulnerability is and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce it (a URL, a payload, a request).
- The commit or deployed version you tested against.

## Response expectations

This is a personal project maintained by one person, not a company with a
security team: there's no guaranteed response-time SLA. Reports are taken
seriously and acknowledged as soon as reasonably possible, typically within
a few days.

## Disclosure

Please give a reasonable amount of time to address a confirmed issue
before any public disclosure. Credit is happily given in the fix's commit
message or release notes, if you'd like it.
